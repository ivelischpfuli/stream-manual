# Welcome to the Iveli Alpaca stream!

I'm Iveli Alpaca, and I'm the one responsible for this mess you're about to subject yourself to.  Thankfully, this manual will help maximize your survival instinct.

Most things here were set up by me with the power of SAMMI, LandiTube, the Twitch Integrated Throwing System

# What the hell?

It can be a bit overwhelming, but this stream has quite a few features to make it an interactive and enjoyable experience.  Think of it like a game you can play as you watch.

Here is a quick glossary of terms

TITS - "Twitch Integrated Throwing System", the thing that throws objects at me.
SAMMI - "Stream Automation, Management, Monitoring & Innovation", the software that makes everything here possible.
LandiTube - The thing that makes my avatar bounce around and stuff!  Runs off SAMMI, created by Landie.
Lemons - This channel's version of Channel Points (when life gives you Lemons...)
Plenty - The fake currency used in the pick-pocketing system.  It's called "Plenty" because you want PLENTY of it.  Currently has no use.
Dango/Dangonya - Resident fat French cat, real name Felicity Petit, used for the Text to Speech (TTS), and sometimes appears in the FAT AND SASSY redeem.

You can use Lemons.

## The combo counter!

As objects hit me in quick succesion, this increases the COMBO counter.  How high can you get it?  Try working together with your fellow viewers!

After the combo ends, total damage is tallied up, and the combo will get a random rating

Currently, combos and damage are purely cosmetic.

# Chat commands, as simple as BANG!

There are quite a few chat commands that anyone can use which cause various effects.

!taunt - Causes me to taunt, which displays a random alpaca for a brief moment.  There is essentially no cooldown on this, so it can be used over and over.

But, if an item hits me shortly after I taunt...

![parry gif](media/parry.gif)

I'll parry it!  This causes the item to do no damage and not count toward the combo counter.  It looks cool though?

!alpaca - Shares a random alpaca fact.  May or may not be completely accurate (most are accurate though).
!stoat - Shares a random stoat fact.  What could this imply?
!lurk - A simple lurk command, doesn't do much else.

# TTS
