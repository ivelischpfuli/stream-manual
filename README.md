I'm Iveli Alpaca, and I'm the one responsible for this mess you're about to subject yourself to.  Thankfully, this manual will help maximize your survival instinct.\

Twitch Integrated Throwing System\


# What the hell?
It can be a bit overwhelming, but this stream has quite a few features to make it an interactive and enjoyable experience.  Think of it like a game you can play as you watch.\
\
***Also please for the love of God***\
***use the Check-In redeem***\
*Twitch keeps changing the rules of the game and I can barely keep up*\
\
Here is a quick glossary of terms\
\
*TITS* - "Twitch Integrated Throwing System", the thing that throws objects at me.  Can be found here https://remasuri3.itch.io/tits/ \
*Lemons* - This channel's version of Channel Points (when life gives you Lemons...)\
*Plenty* - The fake currency used in the pick-pocketing system.  It's called "Plenty" because you want PLENTY of it.  Currently has no actual use.\
*Dango/Dangonya* - Resident fat French cat, real name Felicity Petit, used for the Text to Speech (TTS), and sometimes appears in the FAT AND SASSY redeem.\
*Iveli-verse* - Catch-all term for characters and things I've made.

# Music?
*Type: non-interactible passive*\
\
The music that plays on the Starting and BRB screens are various original tracks I've made!\
You can find most of the songs on my YouTube channel.  The following link will bring you to most of my original work.\

# Big fat bouncy Twitch Intergrated Throwing System
*Type: Channel Point redeem*\
\
You can use Lemons.

# The combo counter!
*Type: Channel Point redeem*\
\
As objects hit me in quick succesion, this increases the COMBO counter.\
\
![counter](media/comboCounter.jpg)

After the combo ends, total damage is tallied up, and the combo will get a random rating.\
\

\
How high can you get it?  Try working together with your fellow viewers!\
*Protip: "Throw Two Objects" can be used to help build and maintain a combo!*\
\
Currently, combos and damage are purely cosmetic.

# The Curse
*Type: Channel Point redeem*\
\
Has various effects.  What are the effects?\
\
*Well, you should watch the stream and you may periodically see...*

# Chat commands, as simple as BANG!
*Type: Chat message*\
\
There are quite a few chat commands that anyone can use which cause various effects.\
\
!taunt - Causes me to taunt, which displays a random alpaca for a brief moment.  There is no cost or cooldown, so it can be used over and over.\
\
![taunt gif](media/taunt.gif)
\
But, if an item hits me shortly after I taunt...\
\
![parry gif](media/parry.gif)

I'll parry it!  This causes the item to do no damage and not count toward the combo counter.  It looks cool though?\
\
!manual or !commands or !faq - Brings up a link to the manual.  You're here right now!\
!alpaca - Shares a random alpaca fact.  May or may not be completely accurate (most are accurate though).\
!stoat - Shares a random stoat fact.  What could this imply?\
!lurk - A simple lurk command, doesn't do much else.\
!pet - Pets the alpaca.  Plays a little animation and sound.\
!save - Reminds me to save.  Plays a little animation and sound.

# Sounds!!
*Type: Channel Point redeem*\
\
There are many sounds.

# Pickpocketing game!
*Type: Channel Point redeem/chat message*\
\
You can use the "Pickpocket Me" redeem to accumulate Plenty.  Once you have some Plenty, you can use the *!pickpocket [username]* command to STEAL Plenty from another chat member!\
*(Currently you need to type the user's name verbatim because I'm dumb and don't know how to properly code*\
\
The !currency command will tell you how much Plenty you have.\
\
*Disclaimer: Plenty is a fictional currency and holds no actual monetary value.  Plenty cannot be bought with money nor can it be exchanged for goods, services, or real currency.  It only exists within the confides of the Iveli-verse.*

# Russian Roulette?!
*Type: Channel Point redeem*\
\
Once a stream, you can test your luck with this dangerous contraption.  An animation will play, and you will have a 1 in 6 chance of receiving a 30 minute timeout.\

\
*Which is the lucky outcome?  I don't know!*

# Text to Speech, featuring Dangonya
*Type: Channel Point Redeem*\
\
Dangonya will speak whatever Godless nonsense you send to her.\
\
![Dango idle](media/dangoTalkIdle.gif)
\
Additionally, there are unique sound effects you can insert into the middle of her sentences!\
**These MUST be typed verbatim or they will not work!**\
\*alarm*\
\*argh*\
\*bloop*\
\*burp*\
\*bwomp*\

# ...doll?

\
*Do not make eye contact with it.*\
*Do not attempt to communicate with it.*\
*Do not listen to anything it says.*\
\
This is the antagonist.  It'll go away if you tell it to SHUT THE F#!% UP.\
*Now with up to only 40% spider eggs*
